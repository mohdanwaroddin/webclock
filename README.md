# webclock :heart_eyes:

This was my first mini project, where I learnt many new things.
I learnt how to use time and date domain as whole project is based on time and date domains. :fire:
I developed this website which is quite similar with android Clock app, which provide all the basic functionalities such as Clock, Alarm, Timer and Time zones of different coutries and places.
